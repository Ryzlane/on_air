##  1. Intro

This is school project based on rock music, made at [@ecolehetic](https://github.com/ecolehetic).

You're going to be transported in a rock universe (just like in your dreams) to discover which rock style suits you perfectly. Yeah, our algorithms are really powerfull.

## 2. Instruction

 - Step 1 : Home page, wait the end of the loader to start the experience. Read the instructions.
 
 - Step 2 : Move in the room with the arrows of the keyboard or the WASD. Move the camera with the mouse. Explore the room, listen the music emanating from the posters. 

 - Step 3 : After having listening all music from the posters, select /click on the one who emits the music you prefer. You will be transported in a new scene. A button will appear in front of you for move on to the next stage. 

 - Step 4 :  Repeat the previous operation until the final choice. You will have a playlist and a poster given, depending on your previous choices. 

## 3. Features

1. Page loading, it allows the page to generate it behind. 

2. Echo of the sound. The more we approach a poster, the more we hear the sound which it emits.
